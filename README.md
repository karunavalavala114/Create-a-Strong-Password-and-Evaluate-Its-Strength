🧠 Best Practices for Creating Strong Passwords
Use at least 12--16 characters combining upper/lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
Avoid common words, personal details, or predictable patterns (e.g., "123", "password", birthdays).
Replace letters with symbols or numbers in a non-obvious way (e.g., "A" → "@", "E" → "3").
Use unique passwords for every account.
Consider passphrases --- a sequence of unrelated words that are easier to remember but hard to crack.
Use a password manager to securely store and generate complex passwords.
Change passwords regularly or when a data breach occurs.
Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) wherever possible.
🧾 Tips Learned from the Evaluation
Basic passwords are easy to remember but provide limited security.\
Adding symbols, numbers, and mixed-case letters significantly improves strength.\
Passwords with randomized character placement are nearly impossible to brute-force.\
Ultra-complex passwords reach 100% strength but may require a password manager for storage.\
Using a balance of memorability and randomness is ideal for most users.
⚔️ Common Password Attack Types

Brute Force Attack Attempts every possible Use long and complex combination until the passwords; enable login correct password is attempt limits and 2FA. found.

Dictionary Attack Uses a precompiled list Avoid common words and of common passwords or predictable patterns. words.

Phishing Attack Tricks users into Verify URLs, avoid revealing passwords via clicking suspicious fake sites or emails. links.

Credential Stuffing Uses leaked passwords Use unique passwords from one site to log for every account. into others.

Keylogger Attack Malware records Keep antivirus updated keystrokes to steal and avoid downloading passwords. from untrusted sources.
✅ Conclusion
Strong passwords are the first line of defense in cybersecurity.
Using randomness, diversity of character types, and good password hygiene practices dramatically reduces the risk of compromise.
Always pair strong passwords with 2FA for optimal protection.
